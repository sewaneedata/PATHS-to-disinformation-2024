# PATHS-to-disinformation-2024
A summer 2024 project in collaboration with DataLab and the University of Catalonia.

This is the repository for the Paths to Disinformation 2024 project by Sewanee DataLab fellows. The project partner, Professor Ana Cardinal, is a political science professor at the Open University of Catalonia. Our partner requested an analysis of two data sets, brought by YouGov (370 participants) and Frothright (584 participants), that track the participants' browsing history in a period that spanned 2-3 months. What our analysis targets is identifying the digital pathways that lead people to misinformation and to see how political ideology or partisanship can affect a person's internet behavior.   

To run this code you have to install R studio and install every library per each script. Mainly what most of the scripts on this repository do is clean the dense data sets that we had and put them in a state from which observations can be inferred. Our observations/results are represented as both our identified pattern of how people come across misinformation, and a linear regression model that offers a quantifiable conclusion to the relationship between political affiliation bias and the consumption of disinformation.
