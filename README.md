# PATHS-to-disinformation-2024
A summer 2024 project in collaboration with DataLab and the University of Catalonia.

This a repository for the Paths to Disinformation 2024 project by DataLab fellows. The partner, Professor Ana Cardinal, is a political science professor at the Open University of Catalonia. OUr partner requested an analysis of two Data sets, brought by YouGov and Frothright, that track the sample's browsing history in a period that spanned 2-3 months. What our analysis targets is identifying the digital pathways that lead people to misinformation and to see how political ideology or partisanship can affect a person's internet behavior.   

To run this code you have to install R studio and install any library per every script. Mainly what most of the scripts on this repository do is clean the dense data sets that we had and putting them in a state where observations can be inferred from. Our observations/results are represented as both our identified pattern of how people come accross misinformation, and a linear regression offering a quantifiable conclusion to the relationship between political affiliation bias and the consumption of disinformation.
